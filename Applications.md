## Applications

<table style="table-layout: fixed;width:100%;">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2"><h3>Highlighting consumer preferences</h3></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:50%;">
Customers have different preferences. Searching for products that meet a given preference like cosmetics that do not contain alcohol can be exhausting. We created an AR application to ease this shopping task.
Based on the product taxonomy, location information in the product location ontology and ingredients information in the ingredients and allergen ontology, we created a consumer preference demo in AR.
      In this demo we used the query for organic products (among others),that can also be found in the predefined queries above.
